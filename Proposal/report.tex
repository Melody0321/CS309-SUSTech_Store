\textbf{Executive Abstract}
\end{Large}
\end{center}

\begin{large}
	The project is to provide a convenient web service 
for student in SUSTech to buy and sell secondhand goods. 
Three of us will focus on designing the front-end page 
and the other two will focus on back-end part. 

We've already drawn the draft of pages, specified the page 
jumping logic, finished API document and drawn the 
database ER diagram. The appearance and function of 
different pages are divided into three parts and each 
member of front end group will finish one of them. 

At the meantime, the back end group will implement 
the function specified in the API document. We will 
try to connect front end with back end for a few pages 
before 11.1 and more detail about our work plan is in 
the Time line part.

Back-End: Wei Fenglin, Xu Zhuolin

\section{Description}

\subsection{Motivation}

Many secondary market QQ groups exist in Southern University 
of Science and Technology. However, Students' posting and 
requesting goods are always quickly flooded with messages in 
QQ group, and it is not convenient for students to search for 
the goods. 

Therefore, we plan to develop the SUSTech Store Web Service. 
Buyers can search for the products posted by sellers directly 
through the search box . It will be more convenient to buy and 
sell second-hand goods.


\subsection{Feature Description}

\subsubsection*{Use Case Diagram:}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/useCaseDiagram.jpg}
	\caption{Use Case Diagram}
\end{figure}

As the use case diagram shows, the process of using our SUSTech 
Store web service is as follows:

First, the user should register for an account first. The web 
will send him a verify code via Email. Then he can login and 
start to use the SUSTech Store Web Service.

If he/she(following will be represented by B) acts as a buyer, 
B can search goods he wants to buy by label or by keyword 
in search box. Then after he click the product, he can look 
the product's details. Then he can chat with the seller for 
further information or add the products directly to the 
shopping cart. 

When purchasing, he should set the amount 
and enter password for security. Then an email will be sent 
to B's register email also for security. He can view his 
personal page for previous order, recharging, browsing 
transaction history, and post purchase information.

If B acts as a seller, he can post goods via his personal 
page and do all the things buyer's can do. Because students 
usually acts as both seller and buyer.

\begin{large}
	\textbf{Spring Boot: }
\end{large}
Spring is a lightweight container that manages the life 
cycle of beans. It provides powerful IOC, AOP and Web 
MVC functions. SpringBoot simplifies the initial setup 
and development of new Spring applications.
